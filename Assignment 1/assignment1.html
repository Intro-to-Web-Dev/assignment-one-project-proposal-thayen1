        <h1>Assignment 1</h1>
        <h3>Yengkong Thao</h3>
           <p>My overall goal of this website is to hlep teach and/or inform younger 
            kids and maybe some adults about the importance of credit cards. Usually, 
            when people hear the word credit card, they would always say that it's a 
            bad thing and that people should stay away from them. But i'm here to show 
            you that with the right knowledge and being responsible, you can come out 
            on top and learn how to get free stuff because come on, who doesn't like 
            free stuff.</p>
        <h3>Goals</h3>
        <ol>
           <li>Teach/show the importance of credit cards.</li>
           <li>How you can come out on top.</li>
           <li>Why it's important.</li>
        </ol>

           <a href="https://www.apple.com/"><img src="img/modelsite.png" width="800" alt="model site"></a>
           <p id="creditcars">I chose the apple website as my model site because I have 
               always been a fan of how clean, informational, and how it's so easy to use. 
               I also like the way it was set up. For instance, clicking on the music tab 
               brings you to a new page with multiple options for you to click on, which 
               I'm planning on doing with some of my pages explained below. I was planning 
               on doing the amazon page but scrapped it because I found the apple page to 
               be better. </p>

       <h2>Target audience</h2>
           <p>My general audience would people ranging from ages 17 to 30. 
               Mainly because at 17, most people would want to start a credit 
               report and are searching on how to start. At age 30, most people 
               would already have a solid credit report and aren't trying to learn 
               anything else, since most of them already know what to do. The c
               haracteristics are responsible, thoughtful, mature, and determine.
